		<h3>What is this?</h3>
		<p>Millions of pets end up in America’s animal shelters each year.  There are many things people can do to help our shelter pets.  This national video contest lets the public create videos to promote adoption, fostering, spay/neuter, donating and volunteering at animal shelters.</p>
		<p>The Shelter Me Video Contest, sponsored by PetSafe, taps into the creativity of the public to communicate the different ways to help the nation’s shelter pets.</p>
		<p>The Shelter Me Video Contest and the Shelter Me PBS series were created to increase community involvement and adoptions from the nation’s overwhelmed and under visited animal shelters.  The current state of the American animal shelter system is dire; an estimated 6 to 8 million animals enter the nation’s shelters annually and, of that number, 3 to 4 million will be euthanized. Shelter Me focuses on the success stories to bring more people into local shelters to give these incredible animals a second chance.</p>
